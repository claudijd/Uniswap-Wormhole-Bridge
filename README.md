# Uniswap-Wormhole-Bridge

This repository defines the Uniswap Wormhole Sender and Uniswap Wormhole Receiver smart contracts that are leveraged by the Uniswap Timelock contract to perform governance on Uniswap V3 Deployments on remote blockchains.

# Basic Architecture

The following defines the basic architecture by which the Uniswap Wormhole Sender and Uniswap Wormhole Receiver smart contracts are utilized.  The intent here is to provide an effective transport layer by which the Uniswap Timelock contract can conduct governance on Uniswap V3 deployments on remote blockchains utilizing Wormhole.
